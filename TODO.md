# TODO. A backlog of ideas

- [ ] a weekly report could list out count and a summary of all items as email (for example)
- [x] No need for editable habit lines
  - [x] A journal suffices for that and doesn't have any shenanigans
  - [x] Implement a migration and then remove it altogether
- [ ] Add journal to the `today` view
- [ ] Move tools from random-tools to tasks-collector-tools
- Observation-Event migration
  - [x] Migrate observations to have their own ObservationMade/ObservationClosed events
  - [x] Remove `date_closed` on observations
  - [x] Fix event_stream_id on habittracked
    - [x] Implement signals event_stream_id saving on change etc for JournalAdded, HabitTracked...
  - [x] Drop closed observations (migration + replace view in code)
  - [x] Add `event_stream_id` page showing for example, past observations
  - [x] Check if migrations are really reversible
- [ ] add `pub_date` to events and allow for setting different day (yesterday) than now for events affecting a specific date (e.g. HabitsTracked)
- [x] Bring back tasks view
- [ ] Add post-it boards for ideas
  - Use the tasks backend
  - Add another view (with two components â€“ a "shelf" and a "board")
  - Put things from shelf to board
    - Coordinates update
  - Put things back from board to shelf
    - Coordinates remove
  - [ ] ability to move board around
- [ ] Observation Closed History View
  - [ ] [Merge View](https://codemirror.net/try/?example=Merge%20View)
  - [ ] Event timeline component
  - [ ] Better styling
- [ ] Quick notes
  - [ ] Can add via mobile (URL: /q, for example)
  - [ ] Removed after 24 hours
  - [ ] Can be put into a journal comment as list of points quote before comment section
- [ ] Habit summaries
  - [ ] Quick summary - since / from
  - [ ] Lines (days)
  - [ ] Calendar
