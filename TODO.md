  - [x] Lines (days)
  - [x] Calendar
- [x] Remove empty plans/reflections (these should not save)
- [x] Habits – shift around
  - [x] Add slug field
- [x] Add a description to Habit
- [x] Show plan on the tasks utility and journal so that focus/want is more visible
  - [x] Add a view to show today's plans (done with a ViewSet)

  - [x] + add a migration removing recontextualized
- [x] create a view that can migrate all observation updates into journal
- [x] Add tags to journals
- [x] Add daily endpoint that shows all events for a day + plans, reflections, etc.
- [x] Looks like perdiodical must go
- [x] Print a weekly plan on daily page, monthly on weekly page
- [x] Complex mode
  - [x] Link observations together
  - [x] See the whole timeline
  - [x] Linking / relinking should be event based
- [x] Add Lessons (showing Observation Approaches for closed observations)
- [x] Add word count statistics
- [x] /q/ allows adding tasks and setting focus
- [x] Force Removal on too long tasks
  - [x] Mark 4 with two violet dots and 5 with one violet dot
  - [x] Remove task on 5 (~1.25 month)
  - [x] Made progress resets
- [x] Add markings if weekly summary and monthy summary has been added for this period
- [x] If it has leaves, don't progress marks on the category – set to 0

## Pending Tasks

- [x] Add a special symbol in journal to add a line to a reflection
  - Symbols: [x] [~] [^]
  - [ ] How about [ ] for Plan?
    - Need to rethink that / possible to use other input method
- [x] Add a Journal archive view set
  - [ ] Add an event archive view set
  - [ ] Check #253 – is ObservationMade done here?
- [ ] a weekly report could list out count and a summary of all items as email (for example)
  - [ ] Add ell and personality cores to summary
- [ ] Add journal to the `today` view
- [ ] add `pub_date` to events and allow for setting different day (yesterday) than now for events affecting a specific date (e.g. HabitsTracked)
- [ ] Add post-it boards for ideas
  - [ ] Use the tasks backend
  - [ ] Add another view (with two components – a "shelf" and a "board")
  - [ ] Put things from shelf to board
    - [ ] Coordinates update
  - [ ] Put things back from board to shelf
    - [ ] Coordinates remove
  - [ ] ability to move board around
- [ ] Observation Closed History View
  - [ ] [Merge View](https://codemirror.net/try/?example=Merge%20View)
  - [ ] Event timeline component
  - [ ] Better styling
- [ ] Dump database before automatic migration / deployment
- [ ] Quests: merge them with journals
  - [ ] (draft) Use journal for journalling, and quest object as a side to it
    - JournalQuestMeta: quest_id, journal_id, stage
    - where to differentiate logic for stage: Null?
- [ ] Ability to create a task on Google Tasks API from the board
  - [ ] PoC: https://developers.google.com/tasks/quickstart/python
  - [ ] Board action
  - [ ] Board status - scheduled
- [ ] Implement $ on tasks, so that only part of information is shown on the task list, all can be edited
- [ ] Make events out of reflections and plans
  - A single event suffices?
  - [ ] Add autocommit mechanism
    - [ ] Remove on autocommit?
  - [ ] Add manual commit
- [ ] Habits – shift around
  - [ ] Define a list of habits I'd like to track
  - Possible integrations:
    - Internal with events
    - External with GH API
- [ ] Add Expectation model to Habit to track redline/greenline, goal, etc.
- [x] Show plan on the tasks utility and journal so that focus/want is more visible
  - [ ] Weekly plan?
- [ ] Habit: plan satisfied?
- [ ] Threads / split into threads and scopes
- [ ] Journal with reflections from daily reflection from past 7 days
- [ ] Split/merge observations
- [ ] Allow text in parsing triplets if no hashtag is found
- [ ] Add ObservationMentioned event
- [ ] Add plan templates for a day (e.g. Cleaning: ..., Writing: ..., etc.)
- [ ] Add Breakthroughs Plan
- [ ] Add [ ] to journal processing so that it can be used to add a plan for tomorrow
- [ ] Ideally if journal add, etc. returned in their json additional objects that were created, so that can be printed out as a summary then on the frontend
- [ ] Plan from tasks
- [ ] The same view as eventdump but on web
- [ ] migrate distractions to integrity? true-to-self
- [ ] Make good summary view for weeks, etc
- [ ] ell / use that for a quantified satori element
  - on a scale 1-10 how was I close to the "true-to-self" (breakthrough) goal? Was there some task that was connected to the projected outcome elements?
- [ ] Enable login on every page and request
- [ ] Random: Three events and and "find a connection"
  - Pseudorandom -> navigate left/right/top (leave one item, add two random)
  - A graph / network of connections between events
- [ ] Better weekly summarization
  - [ ] Either show something like in tasks-collector-tools (summary of each day with plan/reflection/etc.)
  - [ ] Or make a console tool
- [ ] Refactor text processing for side-effects as a separate layer (e.g. journal -> reflection + habits, etc) – so that can become a more unified mechanism (allowing for on/off processing etc)
- [ ] Either remove projected outcome events from events or handle them in tasks-collector-tools
- [x] Add markings if weekly summary and monthy summary has been added for this period
  - [ ] Completely REFACTOR this code into a better shape
- [ ] How about I do the AREAS for life?
  - [ ] To mark then reflection templates (weekly monthly)
