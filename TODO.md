## Pending Tasks

- AI Ideas
  - [ ] a weekly report could list out count and a summary of all items as email (for example)
  - [ ] Add personality cores to summary
  - [ ] create a quantified satori element
  - [ ] on a scale 1-10 how was I close to the "true-to-self" (breakthrough) goal? Was there some task that was connected to the projected outcome elements?

    - [ ] Coordinates update
  - [ ] Put things back from board to shelf
    - [ ] Coordinates remove
  - [ ] ability to move board around
- Devops
  - [ ] Dump database before automatic migration / deployment
- [ ] Quests: merge them with journals
  - [ ] (draft) Use journal for journalling, and quest object as a side to it
    - JournalQuestMeta: quest_id, journal_id, stage
    - where to differentiate logic for stage: Null?
- [ ] Ability to create a task on Google Tasks API from the board
  - [ ] PoC: https://developers.google.com/tasks/quickstart/python
