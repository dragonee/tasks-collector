# TODO. A backlog of ideas

- [x] No need for editable habit lines
  - [x] A journal suffices for that and doesn't have any shenanigans
  - [x] Implement a migration and then remove it altogether
- [x] Observation-Event migration
  - [x] Migrate observations to have their own ObservationMade/ObservationClosed events
  - [x] Remove `date_closed` on observations
  - [x] Fix event_stream_id on habittracked
    - [x] Implement signals event_stream_id saving on change etc for JournalAdded, HabitTracked...
  - [x] Drop closed observations (migration + replace view in code)
  - [x] Add `event_stream_id` page showing for example, past observations
  - [x] Check if migrations are really reversible
- [x] Bring back tasks view
- [x] Quick notes
  - [x] Can add via mobile (URL: /q, for example)
  - [x] Removed after 24 hours
    - [x] Add autoreload for celery
    - [x] Use standard Python images for celery
    - [x] Celery does not need to wait on PostgreSQL
  - [x] Can be put into a journal comment as list of points quote before comment section
- [x] Move tools from random-tools to tasks-collector-tools
- [x] Bug: Habits tracked on journal save have no event set to published of the journal
- [x] Add taskadd Inbox
  - [x] Add ability to go to `/todo/#board=board`
- [x] Allow for archiving (leave delete)
- [x] Oftentimes, tasks are not loaded, when working on multiple tabs
  - [x] use window.onfocus to reload tasks
- [x] Add a special symbol in journal to add a line to a reflection
  - Symbols: [x] [~] [^]
  - [ ] How about [ ] for Plan?
    - Need to rethink that / possible to use other input method
- [x] Add a Journal archive view set
  - [ ] Add an event archive view set
  - [x] Remove add_published from templatetags
  - [ ] Check #253 – is ObservationMade done here?
- [ ] a weekly report could list out count and a summary of all items as email (for example)
  - [ ] Add ell and personality cores to summary
- [ ] Add journal to the `today` view
- [x] Add `tasks-collector.ini` to the project and set it up with a dummy password for development (done in https://github.com/dragonee/tasks-collector-tools)
- [ ] add `pub_date` to events and allow for setting different day (yesterday) than now for events affecting a specific date (e.g. HabitsTracked)
- [ ] Add post-it boards for ideas
  - [ ] Use the tasks backend
  - [ ] Add another view (with two components – a "shelf" and a "board")
  - [ ] Put things from shelf to board
    - [ ] Coordinates update
  - [ ] Put things back from board to shelf
    - [ ] Coordinates remove
  - [ ] ability to move board around
- [ ] Observation Closed History View
  - [ ] [Merge View](https://codemirror.net/try/?example=Merge%20View)
  - [ ] Event timeline component
  - [ ] Better styling
- [ ] Habit summaries
  - [ ] Quick summary - since / from
  - [x] Lines (days)
  - [x] Calendar
- [x] Remove empty plans/reflections (these should not save)
- [ ] Dump database before automatic migration / deployment
- [ ] Quests: merge them with journals
  - [ ] (draft) Use journal for journalling, and quest object as a side to it
    - JournalQuestMeta: quest_id, journal_id, stage
    - where to differentiate logic for stage: Null?
- [ ] Ability to create a task on Google Tasks API from the board
  - [ ] PoC: https://developers.google.com/tasks/quickstart/python
  - [ ] Board action
  - [ ] Board status - scheduled
- [ ] Implement $ on tasks, so that only part of information is shown on the task list, all can be edited
- [ ] Make events out of reflections and plans
  - A single event suffices?
  - [ ] Add autocommit mechanism
    - [ ] Remove on autocommit?
  - [ ] Add manual commit
- [ ] Habits – shift around
  - [x] Add slug field
  - [ ] Define a list of habits I'd like to track
  - Possible integrations:
    - Internal with events
    - External with GH API
- [ ] Add Expectation model to Habit to track redline/greenline, goal, etc.
- [x] Add a description to Habit
- [ ] Show plan on the tasks utility and journal so that focus/want is more visible
  - [ ] Add a view to show today's plans
- [ ] Habit: plan satisfied?
- [ ] Threads / split into threads and scopes
- [ ] Journal with reflections from daily reflection from past 7 days
- [ ] Split/merge observations
- [ ] fixme: seems like situation field needs to be validated for changes with strip()
  - [ ] + add a migration removing recontextualized
- [x] create a view that can migrate all observation updates into journal
